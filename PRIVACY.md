# Privacy Policy for AutoStopify Chrome Extension

**Last updated: 5/23/2025**

AutoStopify is a Chrome extension designed to automatically stop Spotify Web Player from autoplaying after an album or playlist ends. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

## Information We Collect

AutoStopify does **not** collect or store any personal information from users. The extension only reads certain content on the Spotify Web Player page (such as the current track title) to determine when to pause playback.

We do **not** collect:

- Personal identifiers (name, email, address, etc.)
- Sensitive information (health data, financial data, passwords, etc.)
- Browsing history outside of Spotify Web Player
- Any user input such as keystrokes, clicks, or messages

## How We Use Information

The data accessed by AutoStopify is used solely to detect playback status and automatically pause recommended or autoplay tracks when your playlist or album ends. This data is not stored, transmitted, or shared with any third parties.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, share, or transfer any data collected by this extension to third parties.

## Permissions

AutoStopify requires permission to access content on the Spotify Web Player (`https://open.spotify.com/*`) to function properly.

## Your Choices

You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time through your Chrome browserâ€™s extension management interface.
